                        <td><p>My journey with <i>America Online</i> began in 1992. At the age of 12 a childhood friend showed me the first chat room I would ever experience. I was instantly fascinated by the idea of speaking to dozens of people all over the world. Later, my family would acquire our own subscription. By late <b>1995</b> I was a daily user; interacting with my high school friends and being a general teenage nuisance.</p><p>This site is a result of several years worth of disc collection. Most of the material featured in this website was purchased through various e-Bay lots and auctions. Surprisingly, there is small collectors market for this material and over time the earlier versions of software have sky-rocketed in price.</p><p>The goal of this site, as stated previously, is to archive as much of this installation media and its corresponding packaging as possible. This site is by no means, intended to be an exhaustive collation; rather an attempt at focusing materials all in one place.</p><p>If you would like to contribute to the project you can do so my following the instructions in the project <b>README.md</b>. If you would like donate installation media not currently shown, please contact me <a href="mailto:aimaproject@protonmail.com?subject=AIMA Project Donation">here</a></p>
